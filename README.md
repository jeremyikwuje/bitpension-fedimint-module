# Pensionmint by Bitpension Team
Pensionmint is a retirement savings module for people who run fedimint communities or client. It was created by the Bitpension team. Bitpension is a retirement account that uses Fedimint protocol. This code is for a basic version of our retirement savings module. It can be used by any fedimint federation and works with other Fedimint-based apps, like Fedi App.

Warning: This code was made for the Build4Africa hackathon. It should have bugs because it is still being worked on and is not ready to be used. It is only for testing purposes.

Happy Retirement!
